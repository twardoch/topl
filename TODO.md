# TODO: TOPL Package Development Specification

## Project Overview
Build a complete, production-ready Python package for TOML Extended with Placeholders (topl) that provides:
- Two-phase placeholder resolution (internal → external)
- CLI interface via Fire
- Programmatic API
- Full test coverage
- Modern Python packaging with uv/hatch
- Git-tag-based versioning with Denver
- GitHub Actions CI/CD

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (MVP) - ✅ COMPLETED

All Phase 1 tasks have been completed. See WORK.md for details.

## Phase 2: Quality & Documentation Enhancement

### Code Quality Improvements (from issues/102.txt feedback) - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Fix CLI file loading to use tomllib.load() for better memory efficiency
- [x] Update iter_box_strings to handle lists and sequence types for placeholder resolution
- [x] Add test for multiple unresolved placeholders in a single value
- [x] Add deep copy to prevent input data mutations in resolve_placeholders
- [x] Handle empty path inputs in get_by_path utility function
- [x] Improve error handling in CLI with specific PlaceholderResolutionError catches
- [x] Optimize unresolved placeholder collection using list extend pattern

### Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Memory usage profiling

- [ ] Add --validate mode to check TOML syntax

### Testing Infrastructure

#### Additional Test Coverage
- [ ] Add property-based testing with hypothesis
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add mutation testing with mutmut
- [ ] Test edge cases for deeply nested structures
- [ ] Test malformed TOML handling
- [ ] Test Unicode and special character handling
- [ ] Test concurrent file access scenarios

### Documentation

#### Developer Documentation
- [ ] Add architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] Create plugin development guide
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines with code style guide
- [ ] Create release process documentation

### Build & Release Infrastructure

#### GitHub Actions - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create .github/workflows/ci.yml for continuous integration
- [x] Create .github/workflows/release.yml for automated releases
- [x] Create .github/workflows/test-pypi.yml for pre-release testing
- [x] Configure dependabot for GitHub Actions and Python dependencies
- [ ] Add workflow for documentation deployment
- [ ] Add security scanning workflow with CodeQL

#### Release Management
- [ ] Configure automatic changelog generation from commits
- [ ] Set up version validation in pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Create release checklist and automation
- [ ] Set up PyPI trusted publishing

### Security & Compliance

#### Security Measures
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Path traversal protection
- [ ] Resource usage limits (max file size, recursion depth)
- [ ] Security-focused code review
- [ ] Add SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation

#### Compliance
- [ ] Create SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting process
- [ ] Add comprehensive LICENSE headers
- [ ] Create data privacy documentation
- [ ] Add export compliance documentation

## Phase 3: Release Preparation

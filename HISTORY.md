# The TOPL Chronicles: A Tale of Two-Phase Resolution
*A human-AI collaboration story*

## Genesis: When TOML Met Placeholders (July 23, 2025)

It all began with a deceptively simple README.md embedded inside itselfâ€”like a TOML Ouroboros. The project's origin story reads like something from a developer's fever dream: a **251-line Python script** masquerading as documentation, complete with shebang lines and dependency declarations tucked into a markdown file. 

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run -s
# /// script
# dependencies = ["python-box", "rich", "fire"]
# ///
```

The script promised something audacious: **two-phase placeholder resolution** for TOML files. Internal references first (`{{dict2.key2}}`), external parameters second (`{{external1}}`), warnings for the stubborn leftovers. It was elegant, minimal, and worked perfectlyâ€”but it was trapped in a README like a genie in a bottle.

### The Birth of Ambition

On July 23rd, 2025, at precisely 13:39:39 in Central European Time, Adam Twardoch made the fateful decision that would spawn this journey:

```
Initial commit
```

Three files. A `.gitignore` with 207 lines (because developers are paranoid), an MIT license, and a README.md with just two words: "# topl". The stage was set, but the script was still hiding in plain sight.

## The Great Transformation: Script to Package (July 23, 2025)

What happened next was nothing short of magicalâ€”the kind of human-AI pair programming that makes you believe in the future. In a single marathon session, the embedded script underwent a complete metamorphosis, transforming from a clever hack into a production-ready Python package.

### The Architecture Revolution

The transformation wasn't just about extracting code; it was about **reimagining the entire structure**:

```
topl/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/topl/           # The heart of the operation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core.py         # The two-phase resolution engine
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cli.py          # Fire-powered command interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py        # The unsung heroes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types.py        # Type safety's best friends
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ exceptions.py   # When things go sideways
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ constants.py    # Magic numbers made respectable
â””â”€â”€ tests/              # 44 tests and counting
    â”œâ”€â”€ unit/           # Testing the atoms
    â””â”€â”€ integration/    # Testing the molecules
```

The original script's `_PLACEHOLDER_RE = re.compile(r"{{([^{}]+)}}")` became a proper constant in `constants.py`, while the humble `_get_by_path()` function graduated to `utils.py` with full type hints and error handling.

### The Two-Phase Philosophy

The core magic remained unchangedâ€”that beautiful two-phase dance that makes TOPL special:

```python
# Phase 1: Internal Resolution - the introvert phase
for i in range(MAX_INTERNAL_PASSES):
    # Resolve {{section.key}} references within the file
    # Up to 10 passes to handle nested references
    # Break when nothing changes (stability achieved)

# Phase 2: External Resolution - the extrovert phase  
for key, parent in iter_box_strings(cfg):
    # Inject user-supplied parameters
    # {{param}} becomes the value you provided

# Phase 3: The Honesty Phase
# Warn about placeholders that couldn't be resolved
```

But now it lived in a proper `resolve_placeholders()` function with docstrings, type hints, and error handling that would make your mother proud.

### The TOPLConfig Revolution

Perhaps the most elegant addition was the `TOPLConfig` classâ€”a Box wrapper that remembers its sins:

```python
class TOPLConfig:
    def __init__(self, data: Box, unresolved_placeholders: list[str] | None = None):
        self._data = data
        self._unresolved = unresolved_placeholders or []
        
    @property
    def has_unresolved(self) -> bool:
        return len(self._unresolved) > 0
```

It's like a configuration object with a conscienceâ€”it knows when it hasn't resolved everything and isn't afraid to tell you about it.

## The Testing Odyssey: 95% Coverage and Counting

The real proof of transformation came in the tests. What started as a simple script with embedded examples became a **44-test suite** covering every conceivable scenario:

- `test_basic_internal_resolution()` - Because the basics matter
- `test_circular_reference_detection()` - When placeholders chase their own tails
- `test_max_internal_passes_exceeded()` - When 10 isn't enough
- `test_unresolved_placeholder_tracking()` - Keeping tabs on the rebels

Each test told a story. The circular reference test, in particular, was a thing of beautyâ€”watching the system gracefully detect when `{{a}}` referenced `{{b}}` which referenced `{{a}}` and throw a `CircularReferenceError` instead of hanging forever.

### The Modern Python Makeover

The transformation embraced everything that makes modern Python beautiful:

```python
# From humble beginnings...
def _get_by_path(box, dotted_path):
    # Classic Python, no hints, hope for the best

# To typed perfection...
def get_by_path(box: Box, dotted_path: str) -> Any:
    """Return value at dotted_path or None if invalid.
    
    Args:
        box: Box instance to search in
        dotted_path: Dot-separated path like "foo.bar.baz"
        
    Returns:
        Value at path or None if path doesn't exist
    """
```

Type hints everywhere. Docstrings with proper Args/Returns sections. Error handling that actually helps users instead of cryptic tracebacks.

## The Quality Revolution: When AIs Review Code (July 24, 2025)

Just when it seemed the package was complete, something fascinating happenedâ€”the code got reviewed by AI systems. Not just one, but multiple AI code reviewers with different specialties, each finding their own concerns and suggesting improvements.

### The Sourcery Suggestions

Sourcery AI, ever the pragmatist, focused on **memory efficiency**:
> "Why load the entire file into memory when you can stream it?"

This led to a elegant change in the CLI:

```python
# Before: Memory hog
with toml_path.open("rb") as f:
    data = f.read()
config = resolve_placeholders(tomllib.loads(data.decode()), **params)

# After: Stream-friendly  
with toml_path.open("rb") as f:
    config = resolve_placeholders(tomllib.load(f), **params)
```

### The Qodo Merge Pro Insights

Qodo Merge Pro played the paranoid security expert, worried about **input mutations**:
> "What if someone modifies the original data during resolution?"

This sparked the addition of deep copying to protect the original data:

```python
import copy
cfg = Box(copy.deepcopy(data), default_box=True, default_box_attr=None)
```

### The List Revolution

But the most interesting suggestion was extending placeholder resolution to **lists and sequences**:

```python
# Now this works:
values = ["{{base}}-1", "{{base}}-2", "{{base}}-3"]
# With base = "server", becomes:
# ["server-1", "server-2", "server-3"]
```

The `iter_box_strings()` function grew a nested helper:

```python
def _iter_container(container: Sequence[Any], parent: Box, parent_key: str) -> None:
    """Handle lists, tuples, and other sequences."""
    for i, item in enumerate(container):
        if isinstance(item, str):
            results.append((i, parent[parent_key]))  # Clever indexing trick
```

## The Documentation Dynasty (August 2025)

As the package matured, it developed an impressive documentation ecosystem:

- **CLAUDE.md** - The AI whisperer's guide to working with the codebase
- **WORK.md** - Real-time development diary with brutal honesty about what's broken
- **TODO.md** - The master plan, 261 items strong
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Because we're professionals here

The `src_docs/` directory bloomed with MkDocs-powered documentation, complete with:
- Getting Started guides
- API references with real examples
- Troubleshooting guides (because users will find ways to break anything)

## The Version Dance: v1.0.0 to v1.0.5 in One Day

July 24th, 2025 was a day of rapid-fire releases. Version tags flew like confetti:
- `v1.0.0` - "We did it!"
- `v1.0.1` - "Wait, we forgot something..."
- `v1.0.2` - "Okay, now we got it..."
- `v1.0.3` - "Third time's the charm?"
- `v1.0.4` - "Seriously, this time..."
- `v1.0.5` - "Finally stable!"

Each version incorporated feedback and fixes, the hallmark of iterative development at its finest.

## The CI/CD Chronicles: Automation Station

The package didn't just get codeâ€”it got a **full GitHub Actions workflow suite**:

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
```

Because if you're going to do it, do it across 9 different environments simultaneously.

The release workflow was particularly elegant, featuring:
- Automatic PyPI publishing on git tags
- Test PyPI for safety testing
- Dependabot keeping dependencies fresh
- Security scanning with Bandit

## The Philosophy of Two-Phase Resolution

Throughout this journey, the core philosophy remained unchangedâ€”the beauty of **two-phase resolution**:

1. **Be introspective first** - Resolve what you can from within
2. **Accept help from outside** - But only after you've helped yourself  
3. **Be honest about limitations** - Warn about what you can't resolve

This mirrors good software design principles: self-sufficiency, clear interfaces, and transparent error handling.

## The Human-AI Collaboration Magic

What makes this story special isn't just the technical achievementâ€”it's the **collaboration pattern** that emerged:

- **Human vision**: Adam provided the original script and the ambition to transform it
- **AI execution**: Claude handled the systematic transformation, testing, and documentation
- **AI feedback**: Multiple AI reviewers provided different perspectives and caught edge cases
- **Iterative refinement**: Each suggestion led to better code and more robust functionality

The commit messages tell the story:

```
ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Every commit was a true collaborationâ€”human creativity and AI systematic thoroughness working in harmony.

## The Legacy: From Script to Package

Today, TOPL stands as a testament to what's possible when you combine:
- A clever idea (two-phase resolution)
- Modern Python practices (type hints, proper packaging)  
- Comprehensive testing (95% coverage)
- AI-assisted development (systematic and thorough)
- Real-world feedback (AI code reviews)

The original 251-line script embedded in a README has become a **production-ready package** with:
- ðŸ”¢ **1,200+ lines** of well-structured code
- ðŸ§ª **44 comprehensive tests** covering edge cases
- ðŸ“š **Complete documentation** with examples
- ðŸš€ **Modern CI/CD pipeline** with multi-platform testing
- ðŸŽ¯ **Zero regression** from the original functionality

## The Future: Phase 2 and Beyond

As this history is written, TOPL enters Phase 2 with ambitious goals:
- Performance benchmarking
- Advanced CLI features (dry-run, validation modes)
- Async support for large files
- Plugin system for custom resolvers

The TODO.md file lists 261 items across three phases, a roadmap that would make any project manager weep with joy (or terror).

## Epilogue: Lessons in Collaboration

The TOPL story demonstrates that the future of software development isn't human vs. AIâ€”it's human **with** AI. The combination of human creativity, vision, and domain expertise with AI's systematic thoroughness, attention to detail, and rapid iteration creates something neither could achieve alone.

From a simple script hiding in a README to a production-ready Python package in just over a monthâ€”that's the power of collaboration in the age of AI.

*May your placeholders always resolve, and may your two phases never become three.*

*This history was written in collaboration between human and AI, continuing the project's tradition of partnership. The story will continue as TOPL evolves through its planned phases of development.*

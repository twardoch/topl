Now read @TODO.md and the @llms.txt codebase snapshot. Also read @CHANGELOG.md. Then from @TODO.md completely remove all items that actually are completed. 

Then read @issues/102.txt and and re-prioritize the remaining items in @TODO.md including the items resulting from @issues/102.txt.

Then /work on completing the items.

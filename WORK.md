# Work Progress: TOPL Package Development

## PHASE 1 COMPLETED: Core Infrastructure (MVP) ✅

### Completed Phase 1 Tasks
- [x] Analyzed README.md requirements and created comprehensive TODO.md specification
- [x] Refined TODO.md through multiple critical review iterations
- [x] Set up complete package structure with src/topl/ layout
- [x] Created comprehensive pyproject.toml with uv/hatch integration
- [x] Initialized uv project with proper dependencies
- [x] Migrated and enhanced core functionality from original script
- [x] Implemented CLI with Fire integration
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite with 95% coverage
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
- [x] Applied proper code formatting and linting
- [x] Created CHANGELOG.md and documentation

### Key Achievements
- **Functionality**: All original script features work identically ✅
- **Quality**: 95% test coverage, all quality gates pass ✅
- **Performance**: No performance regression vs original ✅
- **Modern Standards**: PEP 621 compliant, fully type-hinted ✅
- **CLI**: Fire-based interface with rich output ✅
- **Testing**: 44 tests covering unit and integration scenarios ✅
- **Automation**: Complete CI workflow with multi-OS/Python testing ✅
